We'll bubble this convolution up to a single output, and use that to make our prediction.\n",

This approach was necessary because tabular baselines can only take in fixed size data -- not sequential data.\n",

        "But, neural networks (or at least the kind we're building here, as well as many other architectures) _can_ work with sequential data directly. This means that here, our challenge is not one of manual featurization, but instead is one of transforming our raw data into a format suitable for ingestion by this kind of neural network.\n",

        "  1. Neural networks can't take in text features directly. Instead, for our codes (as well as for the `text_value` column, if we wanted to use that), we need to put them in a form suitable for embedding.\n",
        "  2. Neural networks can take in variable length sequences but still have a limit. This means that we need a vehicle to both encode too-short sequences (e.g., a patient who has less data in total than the maximum size sequence our model can process) and too-long sequences (a sequence of patient data longer than this maximum limit). We also need to make sure that when we try to predict a label for a task sample with a given prediction time, we don't use data from beyond that time.\n",

There are many ways we could truncate sequences -- in this case, as we're trying to make a prediction as of a specific time, we'll use the longest contiguous sequence allowed that ends on or before the specified prediction time.\n",
        "3. **Efficient Processing**: We'll follow best practices and perform as many calculations as we can in advance of modeling time, and store just the data we need (in a format suitable for efficient subsequence slicing) on disk before we start modeling. Then, each batch of modeling, we'll just need to load the data we need and we'll be good to go! For this, we'll use existing external packages, and most of the details will be outside the scope of this tutorial."
